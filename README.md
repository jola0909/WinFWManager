# WinFW Manager

A modern Windows Firewall management application built with WPF and .NET 8. Monitor real-time network traffic, manage firewall rules, inspect network interfaces, and visualize traffic flow — all from a single dark-themed UI.

## Features

### Traffic Monitor
- **Real-time packet capture** via ETW (Event Tracing for Windows) — no packet sniffing drivers required
- Live table view with source/destination IPs, ports, protocol, process name, and NIC
- **Positive and negative filtering** — filter by any column, or prefix with `!` to exclude unwanted traffic
- **Right-click context menu** to instantly filter by Source IP, Destination IP, Protocol, Process, or NIC

### Dashboard
- At-a-glance stats: active connections, bandwidth, top talkers
- **Interactive network traffic graph** showing traffic flow between local NICs and remote endpoints
- Hover tooltips with detailed connection info (byte counts, allowed/blocked, top ports, country)
- Filter the graph to focus on specific endpoints

### Rules Manager
- View all Windows Firewall rules with search and filtering
- Create, edit, and delete inbound/outbound rules
- Toggle rules on/off

### Log Viewer
- Parse and display Windows Firewall log files
- Filter and search through historical firewall events

### Network Interfaces
- View all network adapters with status, IP addresses, MAC, speed, and type
- Auto-refreshes on first visit

## Quick Install

### Option 1: Download (Recommended)

1. Go to the [**Latest Release**](https://github.com/jola0909/WinFWManager/releases/latest)
2. Download **`WinFWManager-standalone.exe`** (~150 MB, no dependencies needed)
3. Right-click → **Run as Administrator**

That's it — single exe, nothing to install.

> 💡 **Smaller download?** Grab `WinFWManager-portable.exe` (~15 MB) instead, but you'll need [.NET 8 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) installed.

### Option 2: Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jola0909/WinFWManager.git
cd WinFWManager
dotnet publish src/WinFWManager/WinFWManager.csproj -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained -p:PublishSingleFile=true
```

The exe will be in `src/WinFWManager/bin/Release/net8.0-windows/win-x64/publish/`.

## Requirements

- **Windows 10/11** (or Windows Server 2016+)
- **Run as Administrator** — required for ETW traffic capture and firewall rule management

```

**Key technologies:**
- **WPF** with MVVM pattern (CommunityToolkit.Mvvm)
- **CIM/WMI** via Microsoft.Management.Infrastructure for native firewall queries
- **ETW** via Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.TraceEvent for real-time traffic capture
- **System.Reactive** for event batching and throttling
- **MaxMind GeoIP2** for IP geolocation (graceful fallback if DLL is blocked by WDAC)
